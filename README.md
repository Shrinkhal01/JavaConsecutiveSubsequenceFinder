# JavaConsecutiveSubsequenceFinder

Overview
This Java program, named longcons, is designed to find the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in an array. A consecutive subsequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is one greater than the previous number. The program utilizes a simple algorithm to iterate through the array and identify the longest consecutive subsequence.

Usage
To use the program, simply compile the longcons.java file and run the generated class file. The program is equipped with a sample array named ar to demonstrate its functionality. You can replace this array with your own data for testing.

Algorithm
The algorithm used in this program involves iterating through the array and identifying consecutive elements. The current implementation needs refinement to correctly calculate the length of the longest consecutive subsequence.


Contributions
Contributions to improve the algorithm, enhance code efficiency, or address any issues are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
